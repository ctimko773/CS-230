Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was "The Gaming Room" wanted to move their game "Draw It or Lose It" to other various platforms like Android and IOS. I was tasked with taking all of their requests and analysing each indivual platform like Mac, Linux, Windows, and Mobile Devices and choose which one would most suit the devlopment of the game. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this project what I did best was fully understanding the request of the game devloper and was able to even look past that and take into account things that maybe even the devloper might not realize they need

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

It helps because it allowed me to breakdown the different benefits and downsides to developing on each platform and it also allowed me to have a comprihensive list of what is requested by the devloper like having multiple teams with unique team names as one example.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I would change my reccomendation section because I feel as though I did not go as in depth as I should have in order to justify my reccomendation. 


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I took all the needs into account when devloping and make sure everything ran smoothly and that it was very accessable to anyone and everyone who wanted to play the game. User needs are important especially in this project because the game is being made with the idea that it is a product that is used by the public so knowing how it looks and feels to users will make or break the successfulness of the game.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I would want to use the technique of checking to see if the team name or the players name was already in use as I feel a check like that can have many applications in future projects.
